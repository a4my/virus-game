# Kill the Virus ğŸ¦ ğŸª“ğŸ§¬ğŸ”¬ğŸ”«

This is a silly game inspired by recent events. Your goal is to end the lockdown by killing the virus, your score increases every time you click on the virus particles and it reduces the number of days left until the end of the lockdown.

## What I used ğŸ”¨
The layout of the game is contained over one window and little HTML and CSS was needed. I built this game to practice and develop my logic using JavaScript.
